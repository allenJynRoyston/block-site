## ÔøΩ The Situation

Hi there! I'm Allen, and like many talented developers right now, I'm **actively seeking new opportunities**. This portfolio represents my passion for clean, modern web development and showcases the kind of work I'd love to bring to your team.

## üéØ Why Your Company Needs Me (Seriously)

### I Can Actually Code (Shocking, I Know)

- **12+ years** of real production experience (not bootcamp projects)
- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: This entire site is built from scratch, responsive, accessible
- **Modern tooling**: Vite, Tailwind, component architecture that doesn't suck
- **Clean code**: ESLint, TypeScript, proper git workflow because I'm not a monster

### I'm Motivated and Available

- **Available immediately**: Ready to jump in and contribute
- **Open to relocation**: Have passport, willing to travel for the right opportunity
- **Realistic expectations**: Understanding of current market conditions
- **Responsive communication**: Quick turnaround on emails and calls

### Real Business Value (Not Buzzword Bingo)

- **Performance-focused**: This site loads in under 2 seconds because users hate waiting
- **Mobile-first**: 70% of your users are on phones, I remember this
- **Accessibility compliant**: Won't get you sued for ADA violations
- **SEO optimized**: Because what's the point if Google ignores you?

## üíª Technical Skills That Pay Bills

### Frontend (Where I Shine)

- **Vue 3 / React**: Component architecture, state management, the whole shebang
- **TypeScript**: Because runtime errors are for people who hate themselves
- **Modern CSS**: Tailwind, CSS Grid, Flexbox, animations that don't induce seizures
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress, unit tests that actually test things

### Backend (I Can Do This Too)

- **Node.js**: Express, APIs that don't crash when users exist
- **Python**: Django, Flask, data processing that doesn't take forever
- **Databases**: SQL, NoSQL, whatever makes your data happy
- **Cloud stuff**: AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines that work

## üö® What I Bring to Your Team

### Problem Solver, Not Problem Creator

- **Debug anything**: That weird bug that's haunted your codebase for months? I'll find it
- **Documentation**: Actually writes readable docs because future-me deserves better
- **Code reviews**: Constructive feedback without the ego trips
- **Mentoring**: Can explain complex concepts without condescension

### Communication Skills (Rare in Developers)

- **Speaks human**: Can translate tech jargon for stakeholders
- **Meeting participant**: Shows up, contributes, doesn't derail discussions
- **Remote ready**: Managed distributed teams, async workflows, timezone math
- **Deadline focused**: Understands that "done is better than perfect"

## ÔøΩ This Portfolio Proves I Can:

‚úÖ **Build from scratch**: No templates, no stolen code, just pure craftsmanship  
‚úÖ **Handle complexity**: Multiple layouts, state management, responsive design  
‚úÖ **Write maintainable code**: Clean components, proper TypeScript, documented  
‚úÖ **Solve real problems**: Contact system, dark mode, performance optimization  
‚úÖ **Ship products**: This isn't abandoned - it's production ready

## üôè To Hiring Managers & Tech Leads:

If you made it this far, you either:

1. **Actually need a developer** _(please be this one)_
2. Appreciate honesty about the current job market
3. Are procrastinating on your own hiring decisions

I'm not the "rockstar ninja guru" type. I'm a **solid, reliable developer** who writes clean code, communicates well, and won't disappear after three months. In today's market, that's honestly pretty rare.

**I'm ready to start Monday.** Let's build something great together.

_P.S. - Yes, I'm a little desperate. But desperate developers tend to be very motivated employees. Just saying._
